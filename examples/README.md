# PwnedNoMore Invariant Examples

## Base

Two main test frameworks are supported: [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge).

This example folder supports both at the same time.

## Build

```bash
# As Hardhat repo
yarn install
yarn hardhat compile

# As Forge repo
git submodule init
forge build
```

## Run tests

Currently, PNM invariants could only be run with Forge framework.

```bash
forge test
```
